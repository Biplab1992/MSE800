1. In first assignment of creating a NumPy array of the first 10 positive integers.

# I first imported numpy.
# Then created an array with [np.arange(1,11)] where 1 indicate the start and 11 indicate the stop point but doesn't include 11.
# Now, I print the array
# Again, I print the shape of array with (array.shape) which shows the size of any array which is 10.
# Similarly, I print the data type of an array with (array.dtype) resulting int32 as the result.
# Lastly, I multiplied the array with (array*2) which multiply each elements of array but not the whole.


2. Second assignment

# After importing numpy, i calculated the students average scores with np.mean, here axis=1 will select rows.
# Then for calculation of subject wise average, i follow the similar steps as above with np.mean but axis=0 which will select the column.
# Now, for students with highest score, I first calculate individual students total scores with np.sum and used np.argmax for finding the maximum value in index.
# lastly, [:,2] will select the third row and (+=5) will add 5 scores to all the students
