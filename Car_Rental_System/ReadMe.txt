-------- File Structure and Purpose----------

- main.py
	This is the software gateway. It displays the initial menu and routes the users to appropriate sub menu based on their roles.

- database.py
	This file contains all functions for interacting with Google Firestore, including connections to collections for users, cars, rentals and payments.

- user_manager.py
	Implements the UserManager class, which handles user registration, login, viewing loyalty points, and retrieving payment and rental histories from the database.

- car_manager.py
	Implements the CarManager class responsible for adding, listing, updating, and deleting car records in the database.

- booking_manager.py
	Implements the BookingManager class, which manages the rental processâ€”displaying available cars, handling rental requests (including date validation and loyalty point redemption), simulating payment via the payment_gateway, and saving rental records.

- payment_gateway.py
	Contains the simulated payment processing functionality which prompts the user for confirmation for payment via eSewa.




---------- Bugs and Issues -------------

- Simulated Payment Process:
The payment gateway simulation does not integrate with a real payment API. It relies on user input (yes/no) to simulate payment success.
	
- Multiple booking of cars in same dates:
This system doesn't check for the cars that are already booked for specified dates, but keeps on accepting new bookings.
